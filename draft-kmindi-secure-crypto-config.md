--- abstract

Cryptography providers, libraries and APIs usually define defaults for the offered cryptography primitives.
These defaults have to be kept to be backwards compatible with all users of the API that used the defaults.
Yet, these default choices become insecure at some later point. 
E.g. a key size of 128 bit may not be sufficient anymore.
To keep these defaults up-to-date three things are described in this document: 
(1) A process that is repeated every year, where the
CRFG publishes a new set of default configurations for standardized cryptography primitives, 
(2) a format based on *TODO* that specifies the default secure configuration of this (and previous) year(s) and 
(3) a format to derive the parameters from output of cryptography primitives, otherwise future changes of the default configuration would change existing applications behaviour.

# Introduction

[^TODO]

- [ ] TODO Write Introduction
- [x] Mention Main Goals: (0) Prevent insecure cryptography use/implementation for the future. (1) Enable cryptography libraries and APIs to offer secure defaults with inherent future-proofnes; (2) Prevent non-expert programmers from misusing cryptography APIs; (3) Allow standardized definition of secure parameters for cryptography algorithms; (4) Standardized across all implementations; (5) Prevent outdated example code and documentation.
- [x] Mention: Yearly published secure configuration recommendations that can be used per default from cryptography libraries. This prevents aging/maturing libraries from offering insecure default implementations. 
- [x] Mention target group ((1) developers who are not experts but still need to implement cryptography functionality. (2) Cryptography library developers that should integrate SCC to provide secure defaults. (3) standardization institutions (like BSI or NIST) who can use the publication format for their own set of cryptography recommendations)
- [ ] TODO Mention/describe the gap between cryptography concept basics (like all properties of symmetric encryption can be known except the key) vs the standardization process vs the actual implementation. During this concretization much more complexity is added to cryptography for users of cryptography.
  - [ ] TODO even describe this better by describing the basic cryptographic primitives we are concerned about and then describe the current best practice for its standardization (e.g. an RFC) and then an actual often used implementation (e.g. Java SDK Crypto API).

## Motivation
The correct choice of secure parameters when implementing cryptographic primitives or algorithms is not always easy to ensure.
However, the security of the primitives to be used depends mainly on the choice of these parameters (e.g. the correct key length).
In order to be able to prevent insecure implementations and usage of cryptography, it is necessary to assure that the choice of parameters is made correctly.
Unfortunately, this is not always easy.
The correct choice of secure parameters is a big issue especially for software developers who are not primarily concerned with cryptography.
Often, they choose necessary parameters based on documentation which is outdated or shows an insecure parameter set.
Another point that can lead to an insecure choice are cryptographic libraries.
Normally they should provide secure default parameters, but often it is the case that they are insecure or outdated.
Therefore, we also need to prevent the misuse of cryptographic APIs.
Furthermore, it is necessary to find a way to enable cryptographic libraries and APIs to offer a secure choice of parameters.
To alleviate the mentioned problems, it is a good idea to generate and provide a standardized definition of secure parameters for cryptographic primitives.
Such a standard would also lead to a standardization across all implementations. A data structure to represent this standardized definition in JSON {{-JSON}} is given in the following {{dataStructures}}.
This standardized definition of a secure parameter set is referred to as Secure Crypto Config (SCC) in the following.

The publication of a SCC would be helpful especially for developers that are not specialized in cryptography.
Often the basic concept of cryptographic primitives like hashing, in which the plaintext simply gets hashed with the help of a hash algorithm, is easy to understand. But the actual usage can get rather difficult.
This can be seen on the [example of Argon2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-10#section-3.1) in which it is necessary to provide up to 8 additional parameters to be able to start the actual hashing.
There is a huge gap between the concept and the actual implementation.
SCC can close this gap and help the developers to make a secure choice by simply looking into the SCC.
Despite non-expert developers the SCC can also be used as a template for standardization institutions such as NIST or BSI to provide their parameter recommendations in a structured and machine-readable way.
Furthermore, cryptographic library developers can integrate the SCC to offer secure defaults.
But in practice, it is often not possible to simply change the interfaces of existing cryptographic libraries.
Therefore, an additional abstraction layer is needed here, which should provide an easy to use interface for the programmers to actually use the library functions with the secure parameter choice.
An example of such an additional abstraction layer can be seen in {{scc_java_api_example}}.

It already exists a Data Structure for the Security Suitability of Cryptographic Algorithms (DSSC) {{-DSSC}} in an XML-format that stores some of the necessary informationâ€™s, that are also required for the SCC.
DSSC represents a data structure that should support the automatic analysis of security suitability of given cryptographic algorithms.
In contrast to SCC, DSSC does not make suggestions for currently secure parameters that should be used, but is intended for the evaluation of algorithms.
Nevertheless, it can be regarded as a reference, as it contains a lot of information that will be needed in SCC.

(?) The SCC should also have the property of algorithm agility which includes that it should be easy to switch from one set of parameters and algorithms to another.
This is necessary to be able to adapt to the current state of security.
Also, it is important to use a common set of cryptographic algorithms and consider how many choices of parameters and algorithms to provide.
Procedures that contribute to the achievement of these properties are described in more detail in the "Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms" BCP 201 {{?RFC7696}} and the "Algorithm Agility Procedure for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)" BCP 182 {{?RFC6916}}.

One problem in the usage of the SCC is the fact that the defined parameters will change over time.
Therefore, it is necessary to check the SCC with its parameters regularly and adjust them if necessary.
A regular adjustment process once a year, for example, could guarantee this. However, adjusting the parameters is not always easy.
If for example a plaintext should be encrypted one has to keep the same parameters for both encryption and decryption.
Otherwise the ciphertext obtained by encryption cannot be decrypted correctly back again.
In contrast we can see that in the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), parameter changes are comparatively less complicated. For the duration of a connection between client and server, it is possible to choose from different algorithms in advance.
A selection of possible algorithms for TLS with recommendation for their usage can be found for example at the [IANA Registry for TLS Cipher suites](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4).
This issue could be solved by developing different backwards compatible layers. But, it would be more advantageous to store the parameters used for the encryption in addition to the actual encrypted data.
This is also necessary to prevent applications from becoming incompatible with updated SCC over time.
To store this necessary information there already exists a standard named CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) {{-COSE}}.
The parameters and algorithms defined for COSE can be found at the [IANA registry for COSE](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml).
COSE represents a data structure that contributes to the storage of the cryptographic output (e.g. ciphertext) as well as the used parameters in a structured way.

# Requirements and Assumptions

## Requirements

- Information classification: Support different classifications (e.g. TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL)
  - Information classification is not always needed. E.g. many applications require one encryption / hashing algorithm and use only that one for all information encrypted/hashed. But for future proofing it would be good to be able to process information based on its classification.
- Longevity: The time some information must be protected can differ from milliseconds to decades (related to Document classification)
  - Different SCC's based on longevity is not always needed. E.g. many applications require one encryption / hashing algorithm and use only that one for all information encrypted/hashed. But for future proofing it would be good to be able to process information based on its longevity.
- Contrained Devices: Computing power is not always available for both the most advanced cryptography algorithms and their parameters.
- *Threat Model* / adversary powers: What kind of attacker should the secure crypto config protect against? (Almighty? Gouvernment? Company?). Presumably  different group of attackers.
- Which primitives should be covered?
- Which algorithms (per primitive) should be covered?
- Easy to find what is a secure parameter set for a given requirement (e.g. one table, two-dimensional)
- Must be easy to verify which Secure Crypto Config is used / was used (e.g. in Continuous Integration platforms)
- Must be easy to verify the authenticity of the Secure Crypto Config (e.g. is this really what the CFRG has published)
- Easily accessible for library implementation
- Really easy mapping for various programming languages, without complicated/many additional logic/parsing
- Easy to integrate by cryptography libraries
- Experts should still be able to use/access the unaltered output of cryptographic primitives
- Regular updates (yearly?)
- Must be easy to extend/alter by other organizations (e.g. maybe the BSI wants to publish its own secure crypto config that differs from the standardized one. Maybe a hiearchical approach with inheritance from the base SCC?)
- Must be easy to update by the committee
- Interoperability with other standards/formats (e.g. {{-COSE}})
- Recommendation what should be the default secure crypto config for a cryptography library (e.g. should it be the one for TOP Secret or *only* for Secret?)
- Recommendation what should a cryptography library do if it can not support the parameters specified in the latest Secure Crypto Config. (E.g. key size for RSA would be n*2 and the library supports only n)
- Recommendation how should a cryptography library integrate the Secure Crypto Config so that it should be up to date as soon as possible after a new SCC has been published?
