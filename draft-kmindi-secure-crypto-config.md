--- abstract

Cryptography providers, libraries and APIs usually define defaults for the offered cryptography primitives.
These defaults have to be kept to be backwards compatible with all users of the API that used the defaults.
Yet, these default choices become insecure at some later point. 
E.g. a key size of 128 bit may not be sufficient anymore.
To keep these defaults up-to-date three things are described in this document: 
(1) A process that is repeated every year, where the
CRFG publishes a new set of default configurations for standardized cryptography primitives, 
(2) a format based on *TODO* that specifies the default secure configuration of this (and previous) year(s) and 
(3) a format to derive the parameters from output of cryptography primitives, otherwise future changes of the default configuration would change existing applications behavior.

## Motivation
The correct choice of secure parameters when implementing cryptographic primitives or algorithms is not always easy to ensure.
However, the security of the primitives to be used depends mainly on the choice of these parameters (e.g. the correct key length).
In order to be able to prevent insecure implementations and usage of cryptography, it is necessary to assure that the choice of parameters is made correctly.
Unfortunately, this is not always easy.
The correct choice of secure parameters is a big issue especially for software developers who are not primarily concerned with cryptography.
Often, they choose necessary parameters based on documentation which is outdated or shows an insecure parameter set.
Another point that can lead to an insecure choice are cryptographic libraries.
Normally they should provide secure default parameters, but often it is the case that they are insecure or outdated.
Therefore, we also need to prevent the misuse of cryptographic APIs.
Furthermore, it is necessary to find a way to enable cryptographic libraries and APIs to offer a secure choice of parameters.
To alleviate the mentioned problems, it is a good idea to generate and provide a standardized definition of secure parameters for cryptographic primitives.
Such a standard would also lead to a standardization across all implementations. A data structure to represent this standardized definition in JSON {{-JSON}} is given in the following {{dataStructures}}.
This standardized definition of a secure parameter set is referred to as Secure Crypto Config (SCC) in the following.

The publication of a SCC would be helpful especially for developers that are not specialized in cryptography.
Often the basic concept of cryptographic primitives like hashing, in which the plaintext simply gets hashed with the help of a hash algorithm, is easy to understand. But the actual usage can get rather difficult.
This can be seen on the [example of Argon2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-10#section-3.1) in which it is necessary to provide up to 8 additional parameters to be able to start the actual hashing.
There is a huge gap between the concept and the actual implementation.
SCC can close this gap and help the developers to make a secure choice by simply looking into the SCC.
Despite non-expert developers the SCC can also be used as a template for standardization institutions such as NIST or BSI to provide their parameter recommendations in a structured and machine-readable way.
Furthermore, cryptographic library developers can integrate the SCC to offer secure defaults.
But in practice, it is often not possible to simply change the interfaces of existing cryptographic libraries.
Therefore, an additional abstraction layer is needed here, which should provide an easy to use interface for the programmers to actually use the library functions with the secure parameter choice.
An example of such an additional abstraction layer can be seen in {{scc_java_api_example}}.

It already exists a Data Structure for the Security Suitability of Cryptographic Algorithms (DSSC) {{-DSSC}} in an XML-format that stores some of the necessary informationâ€™s, that are also required for the SCC.
DSSC represents a data structure that should support the automatic analysis of security suitability of given cryptographic algorithms.
In contrast to SCC, DSSC does not make suggestions for currently secure parameters that should be used, but is intended for the evaluation of algorithms.
Nevertheless, it can be regarded as a reference, as it contains a lot of information that will be needed in SCC.

(?) The SCC should also have the property of algorithm agility which includes that it should be easy to switch from one set of parameters and algorithms to another.
This is necessary to be able to adapt to the current state of security.
Also, it is important to use a common set of cryptographic algorithms and consider how many choices of parameters and algorithms to provide.
Procedures that contribute to the achievement of these properties are described in more detail in the "Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms" BCP 201 {{?RFC7696}} and the "Algorithm Agility Procedure for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)" BCP 182 {{?RFC6916}}.

One problem in the usage of the SCC is the fact that the defined parameters will change over time.
Therefore, it is necessary to check the SCC with its parameters regularly and adjust them if necessary.
A regular adjustment process once a year, for example, could guarantee this. However, adjusting the parameters is not always easy.
If for example a plaintext should be encrypted one has to keep the same parameters for both encryption and decryption.
Otherwise the ciphertext obtained by encryption cannot be decrypted correctly back again.
In contrast we can see that in the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), parameter changes are comparatively less complicated. For the duration of a connection between client and server, it is possible to choose from different algorithms in advance.
A selection of possible algorithms for TLS with recommendation for their usage can be found for example at the [IANA Registry for TLS Cipher suites](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4).
This issue could be solved by developing different backwards compatible layers. But, it would be more advantageous to store the parameters used for the encryption in addition to the actual encrypted data.
This is also necessary to prevent applications from becoming incompatible with updated SCC over time.
To store this necessary information there already exists a standard named CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) {{-COSE}}.
The parameters and algorithms defined for COSE can be found at the [IANA registry for COSE](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml).
COSE represents a data structure that contributes to the storage of the cryptographic output (e.g. ciphertext) as well as the used parameters in a structured way.

## Use Cases

### Secure Crypto Config Use Cases

The Secure Crypto Config has three main use cases: 

- Centralized and regularly updated single source of truth for secure algorithm and (their) parameter choices for most common cryptography primitives and use cases.
- Machine readable and extensible format so that organizations (e.g. governmental or commercial) can define their own set of cryptography configuration to both allow and to verify the compliant usage of cryptography.
- Cryptography library/API interface description for cryptography API developers and for software developers who can then use that interface.

**Choice of secure parameter set:**
With the help of SCC it is possible especially for non-expert programmers to look up secure parameters for cryptographic primitives in the SCC.
In this way an insecure choice of parameters with the help of outdated example codes and documentations can be prevented.
The published SCC provides a simple and easy way for looking up secure parameter sets.

**Standard for recommendations of parameters:** SCC could be used as a data structure for standardization institutions such as NIST or BSI to provide their security recommendations in a structured and machine-readable way.

**Integration in cryptographic libraries and APIs:**
It is often the case that cryptographic libraries and APIs using insecure default parameters or deprecate over time as the library is updated frequently and security standards change over time.
With the integration of SCC, a constantly secure parameter set can be provided. In this way also the misuse of the libraries and APIs could be prevented.

### Cryptography Use Cases {#cryptoCase}
- TODO [ ] write text for CSPRNG, Key generation, PW derivation if they are staying

The Secure Crypto Config should cover cryptography algorithm and parameter configurations for the following widely used cryptography use cases.
These are mostly no security protocols but cryptography primitives.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric Encryption is an important cryptographic primitive especially as it is usually multiple magnitudes faster both for encryption and decryption than asymmetric cryptography.
Yet, the secret has to be shared with all participants.

Expected input parameters by cryptography users:

- plaintext
- secret key

Expected output: ciphertext.

Additional Parameters often required in practice:

- Algorithm
- Block-Mode
- IV
- Padding-Mode
- Authentication Tag size

Possible secure usage:

- A256GCM;3;AES-GCM mode w/ 256-bit key, 128-bit tag
- ChaCha20/Poly1305;24;ChaCha20/Poly1305 w/ 256-bit key, 128-bit tag

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Beside symmetric encryption is asymmetric encryption another important cryptographic primitive to considered.

Expected input parameters for encryption:

- plaintext 
- public key

Expected output: ciphertext.

Expected input parameters for decryption:

- ciphertext
- private key 

Possible secure usage:

- RSA
- RSAES-OAEP w/ SHA-512,-42,RSAES-OAEP w/ SHA-512

#### Hashing
Hashing is an important cryptographic primitives and is often needed as a part of many other cryptographic use cases e.g. password derivation.

Expected input parameters by cryptography users:

- plaintext

Expected output: hash.

Possible secure usage:

- SHA-512 (TEMPORARY - registered 2019-08-13, expires 2020-08-13);-44;SHA-2 512-bit Hash
- SHAKE256 (TEMPORARY - registered 2019-08-13, expires 2020-08-13);-45;256-bit SHAKE


#### Password Hashing

The secure storage of passwords requires hashing. 
Yet, password hashing requires that the hashing can not be performed very fast to prevent attackers from guessing/brute-forcing passwords from leaks or against the live system.
E.g. it is totally fine for users if the login takes 0.1 seconds instead of microseconds.
This results in special families of hash algorithms which offer additional tuning parameters.

Expected input parameters by cryptography users:

- plaintext
- hash-algorithm

Expected output: hash.

Possible secure usage:

- Argon2id

#### Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNG)

- [ ] TODO do we make suggestions for Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator?
- [ ] TODO remove?

If we have to implement cryptographic code it is often necessary to generate a sequence of arbitrary numbers e.g. for generating a key.
Only secure pseudorandom number generators should be used for this purpose.

Possible secure CSPRNG:

#### Key Generation

- [ ] TODO should key generation be considered? (Symmetric/Asymmetric)

A key is necessary for many cryptographic use cases e.g. symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
Therefore, key generation is an important part while implementing cryptographic code. 

Expected output: key.

Possible secure generation:

- Use of CSPRNG
- Keys derived via derivation function from passwords/other keys



#### Digital Signatures
Signing is an important and often needed cryptographic use case. It is based on the principle of asymmetrical encryption.

Expected input parameters for encryption:

- plaintext 
- private key

Expected output: signature.

Expected input parameters for decryption:

- signature
- public key 

Expected output: valid/not-valid.

Possible secure usage:

- ECDSA
- ES512;-36;ECDSA w/ SHA-512

### Misuse Cases

*"A Misuse Case [...] highlights something that should not happen (i.e. a Negative Scenario)"* [Misuse Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Misuse_case&oldid=941745374)

# Requirements and Assumptions

## Requirements {#requirements}

- Security Level Requirements:
The Secure Crypto Config should define different security levels.
E.g. information has different classification levels and longevity. 
Additionally, cryptography operations could not or much slower perform on constrained devices, which should also be handled with the security levels.
For each security level the consensus finding process and entities shall publish a distinct secure crypto config. 

- Consensus Finding Process and entities:
  - The Secure Crypto Config must be renewed regularly.
  - The Secure Crypto Config must be renewable on-demand.
  - There must be a guideline on which entities must agree to publish a new Secure Crypto Config.
  - There must be a guideline on which entities may participate in the consensus finding process and how they may do so.
  - There must be a guideline on how to determine broad availability of both cryptography algorithms and chosen parameters.

- Publication Format and Distribution Requirements:
  - General:
    - The Secure Crypto Config must be easily publishable by the committee.
    - Standardized unique and distinct names for (1) cryptography algorithms (2) their parameters and (3) the combination of the algorithm with set parameters. 
      Otherwise ambiguity would make it harder for developers and cryptography implementors to make correct and secure choices.
    - There must be a versioning that allows to distinguish between Secure Crypto Configurations and what is the latest Secure Crypto Config.
    - There must be a deprecation process that ensures usage of outdated/insecure Crypto Configurations ceases.
    - There must be an official source where this Secure Crypto Config is maintained and can be obtained from (e.g. via the WWW).
    - The official source format of the Secure Crypto Config must be cryptographically protected to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
    - Other published formats derived from the source format (e.g. for human readability on a webpage) do not have to be cryptographically protected but should be generated automatically from the source format.
    - The official source should also provide information about the Secure Crypto Config Interface that should be utilized for the application of the Secure Crypto Config.
    - The Secure Crypto Config must specify how it can be extended (e.g. more security levels) and how derivatives work.
  - Human readable
    - The Secure Crypto Config must have a human readable format. 
    - The Secure Crypto Config must allow non-experts to find secure cryptography algorithms and appropriate parameters for common cryptography use cases.
    - The Secure Crypto Config human readable publication format should only use easy to comprehend data structures like two-dimensional tables.
  - Machine readable
    - Cryptography libraries, regardless of the programming language, should be able to directly map (without extensive parsing) the Secure Crypto Config to their implementation
    - Must be easy to verify which Secure Crypto Config is used / was used (e.g. in Continuous Integration platforms)
    - Must be easy to verify the authenticity of the Secure Crypto Config (e.g. is this really what the CFRG has published)
    - Must be easy to extend/alter by other organizations (e.g. maybe the BSI wants to publish its own secure crypto config that differs from the standardized one. Maybe a hierarchical approach with inheritance from the base SCC?)

- Cryptography library integration requirements:
  - Easy to integrate by cryptography libraries
  - Experts should still be able to use/access the unaltered output of cryptographic primitives
  - Recommendation what should be the default secure crypto config for a cryptography library (e.g. should it be the one for TOP Secret or *only* for Secret?)
  - Recommendation what should a cryptography library do if it can not support the parameters specified in the latest Secure Crypto Config. (E.g. key size for RSA would be n*2 and the library supports only n)
  - Recommendation how should a cryptography library integrate the Secure Crypto Config so that it should be up to date as soon as possible after a new SCC has been published?

- General Requirements:
  - Interoperability with other standards/formats (e.g. {{-COSE}})
  - The Secure Crypto Config should cover most common cryptography primitives and their currently broadly available and secure algorithms.
  - *Threat Model* / adversary powers: What kind of attacker should the secure crypto config protect against? (Almighty? Government? Company?). Presumably  different group of attackers.
  - The Secure Crypto Config should prevent non-experts to configure cryptography primitives in an insecure way.
  - The Secure Crypto Config should not prevent experts from using or changing all parameters of cryptography primitives provided by a cryptography library/API.

## Assumptions

The Secure Crypto Config assumes that both the proposed algorithms and the implementations (cryptography libraries) for the cryptography primitives are secure.
This also means that side-channel attacks are not considered explicitly.
It is also assumed that programmers, software engineers and other humans are going to use cryptography.
They are going to make implementation choices without being able to consult cryptography and security experts and without understanding cryptography related documentation fully. 
This also means that it is not considered best practice to assume or propose that only cryptography experts (should) use cryptography (primitives/libraries).

# Security Levels {#securityLevels}

The SCC must be able to provide a secure parameter set for different security levels. 
These security levels depend on the following security constraints: **Information classification (SECRET, Confidential), Longevity (less than one day, more than a day), Constrained devices (constrained, not constrained**.
They are defined in {{constraints}} below.
The SCC provides 5 common security levels for which official algorithm/parameter choices are published.

## Security Level 1 - Low

Confidential information, regardless of the other two constraints

## Security Level 2

Secret information, less than one day longevity, constrained device

## Security Level 3

Secret information, less than one day longevity, non-constrained device

## Security Level 4

Secret information, more than a day longevity, constrained device

## Security Level 5 - High

Secret information, more than a day longevity, non-constrained device

## Security Level Constraints {#constraints}

### Information classification

Information classification here is about the confidentiality of the information.
Not all information is equally confidential, e.g. it can be classified into different classes of information.
For governmental institutions usually three classes are used: Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret.
The SCC considers only **Confidential** and **Secret** for its standardized security levels.
Further levels with other classifications can be added by other organizations.
Additionally, in common (non-governmental) use cases data is not labelled with an information class, so one class has to be chosen for the cryptography processing of all data.

The SCC does not endorse a definition of the information classes, yet **Secret** information is to be considered to have higher confidentiality requirements than **Confidential** information.

**Summary: SECRET, Confidential**

### Longevity

The time how long information has to be kept confidential can influence cryptography parameters a lot.
Usually what you talked about with your friends should be kept confidential for a life time.
Yet, a public trade transaction must only be confidential until the trade was executed which can happen in milliseconds.
It directly influences a very important attacker resource: The time an attacker has to try to gain access to the confidential information.
The SCC considers only two ranges of longevity for its standardized security levels: short longevity of less than one day and long longevity of a day or more than a day.
Further levels with other longevity levels can be added by other organizations.

**Summary: less than one day, more than a day**

### Constrained Devices

For cryptography often complex computations have to be executed. 
Yet, not all environments have the same hardware resources available.
E.g. it is not always the case that the used processors have dedicated cryptography hardware or even specialized execution units or instruction sets like {{AESNI}}.
Detailed discussion and definitions can be found in {{-ConstrainedDevices}}.
Yet, their definitions are too concrete to be used in the SCC's standardized security levels. 
Therefore, the SCC uses defines constraint devices not based on concrete processing power (e.g. 100k instructions per second):

A device is constrained when it has **multiple orders of magnitudes** less resources than a current (not a new one, but broadly in use at the time of publication of a Secure Crypto Config!) standard personal computer.

For example if a current standard personal computer can encrypt with 1 GiB/s, a constrained device would be all devices that can only perform the same cryptography operation with less than 10 MiB/s.
Resources can be everything important for cryptography like dedicated cryptography hardware, instruction sets, memory, power consumption, storage space, communication bandwidth, latency etc. 
The SCC considers only **constrained** and **non-constrained** for its standardized security levels.
Further levels with other constrained resource definitions can be added by other organizations.

**Summary: constrained, non-constrained**

### n-Bit-Security

n-Bit Security Level:

> A cryptographic mechanism achieves a security level of n bits if costs which are equivalent to 2^n calculations of the encryption function of an efficient block cipher (e.g. AES) are tied to each attack against the mechanism which breaks the security objective of the mechanism with a high probability of success. BSI

- [ ] TODO add n-Bit-Security to Security Levels in time-independent way (e.g. referring to increases in bit instead of hardcoded values for the levels)

### Attacker Resources and Capabilities 

The SCC considers only the following same attacker resources and capabilities for all standardized security levels:

- The attacker knows all used algorithms and parameters except secrets according to Kerckhoffs's principle. 
- The attacker has access to the system used for cryptography operations and can utilize its cryptography operations apart from obtaining secrets. *TODO is a more formal definition useful, e.g. a list of [Attack Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model)?* *TODO What about side-channels, especially if the attacker has access to the system?*
- The attacker can utilize very high-performance computing resources such as super computers and distributed computing (e.g. this includes very high memory, storage, processing and networking performance)

Further levels with other attacker definitions can be added by other organizations.

## Security Level Extensions/Extendability

- [ ] TODO adapt content? 

One requirement of the SCC is that it must be easy to extend/alter (see {{requirements}}).
It is still possible to change, add or remove some of the here proposed security levels.
E.g. entities that are participating in the consensus finding process could define additional levels. 

# Consensus Finding Process and entities {#consensus}

To provide a SCC it is necessary to agree upon a secure and appropriate cryptographic parameter set for each security level (see {{securityLevels}}).
This should happen in a common consensus finding process which takes place at regular intervals e.g. every year. 
During this process the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) decides in cooperation with other institutions like the Bundesamt fÃ¼r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) or the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for a set of secure parameters.
After the successful decision the agreed on parameters can be added in the proposed JSON data structure (see {{dataStructures}}) and provided on an appropriate platform.

## Consensus Finding

Consensus must be found one year after the last consensus was found.
This ensures that there is a new Secure Crypto Config every year, even if the configuration itself has not changed.

### Regular Process 

The process has three phases that MUST be finalized within 2 years:

- (1) One year **Proposal phase** during which all participating entities must propose at least two cryptography algorithms and parameters per cryptography use case per security level.
- (2) Six months **Consensus finding phase** during which all participating entities must agree on a common secure crypto config.
- (3) Six months **Publication phase** ensures the publication of the final secure crypto config AND allows the Secure Crypto Config Interface and other cryptography implementations to integrate the necessary changes.

- [ ] TODO format for Proposal phase submission

During the Proposal phase the proposed algorithms should be submitted in table form like proposed in {{scc_useCase_level_constrained}}.
This table format is simply structured and is easy to read by human as the Consensus finding phase can only be done manually.
It is important that the parameters for each cryptographic use case depending on its security level can be found easily by the participants of the consensus finding process such that it is possible to get to an agreement faster.

### Emergency Process {#emergency}

In cases when a regularly still valid Secure Crypto Config would become insecure regarding either a proposed algorithm or a proposed parameter choice it must be revised with the following process:

1. Determine the insecure configuration.
2. Remove the insecure configuration. *(TODO: would replacing also be an option? how?)*
3. Publish the revised Secure Crypto Config with a new *(TODO "patch"?)* version.
4. Mark the old (unrevised) Secure Crypto Config as deprecated.

Examples for emergency cases are drastically better brute force algorithms or brute force performance (e.g. quantum computers/algorithms), drastically discovered flaws in proposed algorithms and their configurations.

### Requirements for Selection of Cryptography Algorithm and Parameters

The Secure Crypto Config MUST only propose cryptography algorithms and parameters that fulfill the following requirements:

- Cryptography algorithms and parameters have stable implementations in at least two different programming languages.
- Cryptography algorithms and parameters have a defined standard to store the algorithm and parameter identification alongside the result (e.g. like {{-COSE}}). 
  This is required to ensure cryptography operation results can be processed even if the default parameters have been changed or the information has been processed with a previous version of the Secure Crypto Config.
- Cryptography algorithms that support parametrization to adapt to increased brute force performance and to allow longevity of the algorithm especially for hardware optimized implementations.

The Secure Crypto Config SHOULD only propose cryptography algorithms and parameters that fulfill the following requirements:

- Cryptography algorithms and parameters are defined in a globally accepted standard which was suspect to a standardization process.
- Cryptography algorithms and parameters are licensed under a license that allows free distribution.

## Entities

Entities that participate in the proposal phase SHOULD have significant cryptography expertise.
Entities that participate in the consensus finding phase MUST have significant cryptography expertise.

- [ ] TODO what is "significant cryptography expertise"?

The following list gives an overview and examples for the available registries at IANA for cryptography algorithm and their parameters.

- [AEAD Algorithms](https://www.iana.org/assignments/aead-parameters/aead-parameters.xhtml)
- [CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml)
- [Named Information Hash Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg)

But often there is no matching algorithm specification in existing IANA registries that support our selection of parameters.
E.g. in {{?RFC5116}} the definition for AEAD_AES_128_GCM proposes a nonce length of 96 bit.
If we want to use a length higher than this we have to look for another registry than [AEAD Algorithms](https://www.iana.org/assignments/aead-parameters/aead-parameters.xhtml), because there is no specification supporting a higher nonce length. 
However, for cryptographic use cases such as asymmetric encryption and digital signing appropriate algorithm specifications can be found in the [CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml) registry.
For the crypto use case hashing the [Named Information Hash Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg) defines appropriate specifications for hash algorithms that matches a possible set of parameters for the SCC.
It is difficult to find a specification of an algorithm inside existing IANA registries that exactly match all of the chosen parameters for a specific cryptographic use case, especially in the case of symmetric encryption.
It is also tedious to search for different specifications in different registries.
Therefore, it could be advantageous to create a IANA registry explicitly for the creation of SCC.

## Versioning {#version}

The Secure Crypto Config Format is regularly published in a specific year. 
Therefore, the Secure Crypto Config format MUST use the following versioning format: **YYYY-PATCH**.
YYYY is a positive integer describing the year (using the Gregorian calendar, and considering the year that has not ended in all time zones, cf. Anywhere on Earth Time) this specific Secure Crypto Config was published.
PATCH is a positive integer starting at 0 and only increasing for emergency releases.

## Naming {#naming}

The Secure Crypto Config uses the following naming conventions to prevent ambiguity and remove implementation choices:
 - [ ] TODO propose naming for secure crypto configurations
 - [ ] TODO maybe merge with versioning section before
 - [ ] TODO keep in mind the secure crypto config interface, which should be able to use these naming conventions in multiple programming langauges
 - [ ] TODO possibly: SCC_SecurityLevel_**Security Level Number**" ? Put the corresponding number in **Security Level Number** depending for which security level the SCC is created for.

## Data Structures {#dataStructures}

- [ ] TODO necessary in this way?
- [ ] TODO is it possible to define new algorithm/parameter combinations on the fly (in extensions/derivations) or are only SCC IANA registry identifiers allowed/usable?
- [ ] TODO What is with parameters that have to be chosen during runtime? (e.g. the length of the nonce can be specified but not its content?) Maybe refer to how the [PHC String Format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md) describes how parameters must be defined and only allow constants and csprng generated content?
- [ ] TODO is JSON a appropriate format?
- [ ] TODO How is COSE more appropriate/in parts of JSON? or is a mapping (=> parsing needed) better between COSE<->JSON?


For each defined security level a distinct JSON-file must be provided. 
These files must follow a common schema and contain the suitable parameters depending on its security level. 
The general schema of the JSON files is shown in {{scc_general}}.

~~~~
{::include src/scc_general.json}
~~~~
{: #scc_general title="General JSON format"}

- PolicyName: Contains the name of the corresponding SCC according to the naming schema defined in {{naming}}
- Publisher: Contains an array of all parties that were participating in the consensus finding process
  - name: Name of the participating party
  - URL: Put in the official URL of the named publisher
- Version: Contains version in the format defined in {{version}}
- PolicyIssueDate: Date at which the SCC was published in the format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Expiry: Date at which the SCC expires in the format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Usage: Contains an array of all cryptographic use cases defined in {{cryptoCase}} *TODO see SCC IANA registry*. 
- For each cryptographic use case, usually at least two as described in {{consensus}}, agreed upon algorithms with necessary parameters are included. Each of these algorithms with its parameters is specified with its unique identification name defined in the *TODO SCC IANA registry*.

This format allows custom algorithm/parameter selections both by overwriting use cases completely or by adding only specific algorithm identifiers.

# Secure Crypto Config Interface and Implementation Specification

- [ ] TODO Describe used versioning concept for SCC. 
  - [ ] TODO Refer to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [ ] TODO describe requirements for cryptography API implementors and designers
- [ ] TODO decide how the configuration should be made available to programmers
  - [ ] e.g. should there be constants like "SCC_TOP_SECRET_LATEST" and "SCC_TOP_SECRET_LATEST". 
  - [ ] And like "SCC_TOP_SECRET_LATEST.AES" which points always to the latest Secure Crypto Config definition for AES parameters.
- [ ] TODO how should cryptography implementations, that implement/support SCC, generate the parameters?
  - [ ] What kind of parameters can be chosen based on the Secure Crypto Config? => E.g. Should be all except the plaintext and the key for encryption algorithms. Also many parameters can be generated based on cryptographically secure random numbers.
- [ ] TODO The Secure Crypto Config Interface should include a performance evaluation mode which evaluates the performance of each configuration and returns a prioritized list for each configuration. E.g. cf. [Libpasta Tuning](https://libpasta.github.io/advanced/tuning/)

# Cryptography Algorithm Standards Recommendation

- [ ] TODO should there be a template for cryptography algorithm standards (in addition to COSE) for the Secure Crypto Config or is it enough that the Secure Crypto Config Consensus Finding defines the secure parameters for all cryptography algorithms?

# Security Considerations

## Consensus Finding

- [ ] TODO Are these appropriate security considerations?

- Only trustworthy and cryptographic specialized institutions should participating otherwise a SCC with a weak and insecure parameter set could be provided as a result.
- Participating entities should act without political or governmental influences that could affect their decisions.(?)


## Publication Format

- [ ] TODO Are these appropriate security considerations?

- The operators of the SCC must ensure that potential unauthorized parties are not able to manipulate the parameters of the published SCC.
Integrity must also be ensured if potential users want to fetch the provided SCC from the corresponding platform over the network.(?)
- Users should only trust SCC issued from the original(?) publisher on the intended platform.


## Cryptography library implementation

## General Security Considerations

### Special Use Cases and (Non-)Security Experts

The Secure Crypto Config does not apply to all use cases for cryptography and usage of cryptography primitives.
It is meant to provide secure defaults for the most common use cases and for non-expert programmers.
Additionally, non-experts may still implement vulnerable code by using the Secure Crypto Config. 
Yet, it should reduce the vulnerabilities from making the wrong choices about parameters for cryptography primitives.

## Security of Cryptography primitives and implementations

The Secure Crypto Config assumes that both the proposed algorithms and the implementations (cryptography libraries) for the cryptography primitives are secure.
- [ ] TODO is this redundant? because it is also described in the assumptions section.

- Since the validity of the parameters defined in the SCC can change infrequently (e.g. discovered flaws in proposed algorithms) the lifespan of the SCC and an emergency process (see {{emergency}}) should be considered carefully before the actual publication.
- Operators should keep in mind the validity of the provided parameters e.g. to be able to react fast in the case discovered flaws in algorithms.

### Security Guarantees

The Secure Crypto Config does not guarantee security for the proposed parameter configuration.
E.g. a new algorithm that can do brute-force attacks exponentially faster could be existing or published right after the publication of the most recent Secure Crypto Config was published itself.
Yet, the Secure Crypto Config makes a best effort to be as up-to-date with recent discoveries, research and developments in cryptography algorithms as possible.

## TODO

- [ ] TODO Security
- [ ] TODO are some of the listed common issues relevant?: [TypicalSECAreaIssues](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/sec/wiki/TypicalSECAreaIssues)
- [ ] TODO check if security considerations of TLS 1.2 are relevant, especially appendix [D, E and F](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#appendix-D)

### Threat Model / Adversaries {#threatModel}

- [ ] TODO describe adversaries / group of adversaries and their powers
- [ ] TODO describe other general threats for the Secure Crypto Config (maybe put that into the section Security Considerations):
  - [ ] Process
  - [ ] Publication
  - [ ] Content

There are different possibilities in which a potential adversary could intervene during the creation as well as after the publication of the SCC. These attack scenarios must be considered and prevented.

**Process:** During the creation process, it is necessary for selected institutions to agree on a secure parameter set.
It could be possible that one party wants to influence this process in a bad way.
As a result, it could be agreed on weaker parameter sets than originally intended.

**Publication:** After the publication of the SCC a potential attacker could gain access to the provided files on the corresponding platform and change the content to an insecure parameter set.
Depending on the distribution method of the SCC, it is also possible that an attacker could change the content of the SCC as man-in-the-middle.
Especially if a http connection is used to obtain the SCC, this will be a serious problem.
